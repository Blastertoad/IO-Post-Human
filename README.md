# IO Post Human
Welcome to our entry in the Dec 2018 2 button game jam: https://itch.io/jam/2-buttons-jam-2018

Our project aims to provide strong proof of concept that potentially deep and engaging systems need not span massive input schemes.

# The Game
Awaken as a robotic probe, and explore as you uncover the history of a once great civilization. Gather local resources to awaken ancient technology and discover past secrets. But to complete your goal you'll need to be quick or be crafty as limited power and resources exact their toll. Call on the aid of others or discover the past yourself in our non-combative survival exploration game, IO: Post Human.
